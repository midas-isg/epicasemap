These files contain a selectio of metadata for tweets mentioning Ebola from
the time period roughly January 1, 2013 through June 4, 2014.


Overview:

* These are from the spritzer feed, which people treat as a 1% random sample,
  though it's not clear if this is really what it is.

* The files are tab-separated data, no quotes, in XZ compressed format.

* Search: All tweets which contain the word "ebola", case-insensitive, in the
  given fields plus tweet text itself. (Specifically: egrep -i '\bebola\b'.)

* Timestamps are in ISO 8601 format with timezone offset, though all offsets
  are UTC (+00:00).

* Twitter's Field Guide may be useful in understanding the nuances of these
  data: https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets


ebola_geo.tsv.xz: Tweets with latitude/longitude geo-tags.

* Columns:
  1. Timestamp
  2. Longitude
  3. Latitude

* I'm pretty sure the coordinate system is WGS84.

* Geotag rate varies from roughly 0.5% to 2.5% over the sample period. I
  believe a fair ballpark average is 2%. I can provide day-by-day estimates if
  desired.

* Given the above, one could treat this as a 0.02% sample of a geographic
  population of ebola mentions.

* While the search was applied to the three included fields, they are numeric,
  so it is safe to describe these data as tweets which contain "ebola" in the
  message text.


ebola_location-tz.tsv.xz: Tweets with either user location or time zone.

* Columns:
  1. Timestamp
  2. User location from profile (free-text)
  3. User time zone from profile (selected from a few dozen options)

* Tweets which contain user location, user time zone, or both are included. I
  don't know the fraction of tweets with this property.

* It is likely that some tweets where the ebola match came from user location
  are included, as this is a user-entered free text field. That is, I do not
  think it is safe to describe these data as tweets which contain "ebola" in
  the message text, without additional caveats.
